we know port 21 **ftp** is open so we check the ftp port

`$ ftp 10.10.177.190`
using anonymous login we can access the server (hint for anonymous login provided in the name of the box)

Name : anonymous <br>
Password : password

after listing directory we get scripts directory which contains 3 files

we dump these files to our working machine using **get** command 

we get to know that clean.sh is running as a cronjob and its output is stored in removed_files.log and for directory **scripts** we have write permissions, so we change the clean.sh script and upload it to the ftpderver for it to run as cronjob

Modified Script:

to get the reverse shell we listen on 
`nc -lvnp 8080`
 
now we put the **clean.sh** file on ftp server

`ftp> put clean.sh ./scripts/clean.sh`

`User Flag : 90d6f992585815ff991e68748c414740`
### Privilege Escaltion:

For the root flag we have to escalte our privilege. After checking the SUID binaries we get an `/usr/bin/env` binary which we can use to escalte our privilege.

Using the command `/usr/bin/env /bin/sh -p` we can become root and read the root flag from **/root/root.txt**
